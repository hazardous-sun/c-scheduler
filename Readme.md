This project contains the implementation of a Preemptive Priority Scheduling algorithm, developed in C.

Observations:
1. The text file "processes.txt" containing the information regarding the processes to be scheduled must be in the same format as per standard;
2. 1 line containing the information of what each space represents;
3. The following lines must only contain the information about the processes;
4. No blank lines at the end of the file.

Standard:
PID, ARRIVAL, BURST, PRIORITY
